✅ Expand your E-commerce project:

Did you implement user auth? Product filtering? Write about it!
✅ Add a "Learning Journey" section:

"Currently learning [XYZ] – check back soon for new projects!"
✅ Include coursework/practice projects:

Even small JavaScript apps (calculator, quiz) can show skills.
